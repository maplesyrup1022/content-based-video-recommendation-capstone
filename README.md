### Abstract

This project aims to identify and mitigate gender bias in collaborative filtering
recommendation systems from two perspectives, the user side and the content
producer side, namely the director and actor. This research question brings
in practical implications in improving women’s experience with video viewing
websites. We propose a fine-tuning model architecture combining content-based
approach with Neural Collaborative Filtering framework to include multi-media
feature in the training of the model. This potentially adds more robustness to
the model and can better tailor to the disadvantaged gender group’s interest
compared to traditional matrix factorization approach. Our fine-tuning model
mitigates a certain extent of gender bias on the user side and is able to push
forward recommendation for gender balanced films. However, the effect size is
small and more work is needed on the side of the director.
